        <h2>K. J. Somaiya Institute of Technology</h2>
        <p>My favourite class was Analysis of Algorithms</p>
        <aside>My memorable memory of KJSIEIT was of the time when our entire batch was taken for a trek and overnight camp.</aside>

        <h2>Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
        <p>My favourite couse is CS 546 - Web Programming 1 :P</p>
        <aside>My memorable memory of Stevens is of the time when my WP professor scared the sh** out of all students by saying that "You could fail this course". Like who introduces a course to their students with these words, on the very first day?</aside>
